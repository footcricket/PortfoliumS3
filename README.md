## Overview 📋

Welcome to the PortfoliumS3 project, where we demonstrate how to deploy a portfolio website to an Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3 (Simple Storage Service) bucket. AWS S3 is an excellent choice for hosting static websites due to its low-latency, scalability, and cost-effectiveness. This project showcases the deployment of a static website, making it accessible via a user-friendly URL.

## Getting Started 🚀

To deploy your portfolio website to an AWS S3 bucket, follow these steps:

1. **Clone this Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/footcricket05/PortfoliumS3.git
   cd PortfoliumS3
   ```

2. **Configure AWS Credentials:**
   Ensure your AWS CLI is configured with the necessary credentials. If not, use the `aws configure` command to set up your AWS credentials.

3. **Deploy the Website:**
   - Upload your website files to your S3 bucket using the AWS CLI or the AWS Management Console.
   - Configure the bucket for static website hosting.

4. **Access Your Website:**
   Once your website is deployed, it can be accessed using the following URL: [Portfolio on S3 Bucket](http://mini.project.bucket.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com)
